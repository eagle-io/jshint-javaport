# This file lists tests that are known to produce incorrect results when parsed
# with JSHint Java Port:
#
# - Tests that are expected to parse successfully but for which JSHint Java Port reports
#   a syntax error
# - Tests that contain invalid syntax but for which JSHint Java Port reports no syntax
#   errors
#
# Entries should be removed incrementally as JSHint Java Port is improved.
